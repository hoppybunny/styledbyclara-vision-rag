# Visual RAG for Fashion AI Assistant

## Purpose
The goal is to enable users to find personalized fashion recommendations by uploading an image or entering a text query. The system searches through a Pinecone database of 400 real-world fashion images with associated metadata and generates relevant suggestions enhanced with OpenAI's language capabilities.

### Key Features
1. **Visual Search:** Users can upload an image to find similar fashion items.
2. **Text-Based Recommendations:** Users can input textual descriptions to get relevant results.
3. **Multimodal:** The system supports combining image and text inputs for richer results.

## Technical details

### 1. **Database**
- Pinecone vector database.
- 400 fashion images with metadata (name, image url)
- Embeddings: Images are embedded into a 512-dimensional vector space using OpenAI's CLIP model (`openai/clip-vit-base-patch32`).

### 2. **Data preparation**
- Image Scraping
- Embedding Generation:
  - Each image is processed using the CLIP model to generate embeddings.
  - Metadata is added directly to Pinecone for retrieval.

### 3. **System architecture**
- Backend: Python-based implementation.
- Search: Pinecone for similarity search.
- OpenAI's GPT-4 for contextual augmentation.

### 4. **Workflow**
1. Images are downloaded, processed into embeddings, and upserted into Pinecone with metadata.
2. Users can input an image, text, or both.
3. Relevant embeddings are generated and used to query the Pinecone index.
4. GPT-4 provides stylistic and contextual recommendations based on search results. Results include product names, links, and image previews.

### Example Usage

#### Input
- Image: Upload an image of a dress. (sample image is stored in `data/clothes_data.json`)

#### Output
```
Here are some stylish outfit options from StyleNow that you can consider:

## Extension - using ColPali
ColPali is a document retrieval model that uses the power of Vision Language Models (VLMs) to efficiently index and retrieve information from documents based solely on their visual features. This removes the need for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and layout detection as well as complex data ingestion pipelines for PDFs. Colpali operates directly on document images. 

In our use case, Colpali could be applied to fashion catalogs. It could index entire fashion lookbooks or catalogs as-is, preserving the visual richness and contextual relationships between text and images.

However, there were several challenges:
1. Embeddings generated by ColPali were extremely high-dimensional (~99,640 dimensions).
2. Large model requiring GPU to run.
